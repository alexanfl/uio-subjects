[FIGURE 1]

Peaks are not aligned due to differences in the electronics of each the 
64 detectors. 

It doesn't matter if we align to channel 250 or 100.

Find the peak of all gates, then open gainshifts_plain.dat 
and correct them (to f.ex. channel 100).

When we have aligned all gates and made another gainshifts.dat, 
we open the batch file and uncomment/comment the new/old gainshift file.

The smaller time window builds the peaks. 
(???->har vel noe å gjøre med det under)

Thee time of the large tie windows is ~1200 ns, we delay the NaI with 
~460 ns, and see what we get in that time window.

The 1200 ns time window corresponds to the 512 channels.

We find that (1200 ns)/(512 ch) ~ 2.344 ns/ch
and that there 6 channels in the FWHM. 
[FIGURE 2]
=> (6 ch)*2.344 ns/ch ~ 15 ns
[FIGURE 3]
=> (24 ch)*2,344 ns/ch ~ 50 ns
between the beam pulses. (Easier to calculate between the small peaks.)

In our time window, we might get a \gamma corresponding to a
previously excited nucleus that coincidentally emits during our time frame,
though it is unlikely.

To remove the background noise, we start the experiment without any
reactions, and record, then substract this data from the actual data.

In the sorting code (starting at line 567), we see that we sort out
things outside the "prompt peak" ("na_t_c").

and subtract it as background (weight = -1), 
and gate around the prompt peak.
We only subtract one peak (same lenght as the prompt peak).

Steps: align, correct, gate.

Discriminators choose signals that are above some threshold. 
There are two types:
    * Leading Edge Discriminators (LEDs)
    * Constant Fraction Discriminators (CFDs)

CFD looks at the maximum amplitude and (… fraction (???))
LED gives more things to correct, but are cheaper.

Looking at the m_nai_e_t_corrected.eps plot, we see that small energies 
are found higher up on the y-axis (later in time).

Correct the results in root: graph->…
add the $p_0 \cdots p_3$ values to the batch file and do
the same for SiRi (we did it first for CACTUS).
Should do this several times to get a pretty result.
