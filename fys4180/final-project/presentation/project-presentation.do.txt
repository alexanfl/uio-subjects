======= Introduction =======

!split

===== Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory =====
!bslidecell
    * Built in 1979.
    * One of three cyclotrons in Norway, only one for ionized atoms.
    * Field of study is primarily nuclear physics/chemistry.
    * Secondarily is the use in nuclear medicine.

===== Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory =====
!bslidecell 00
Four different particle beams 
    * Proton, Deuteron, $^{3}\text{He}$ and $^{4}\text{He}$
    * We are interested in the reaction $^{28}\text{Si(p, p')}^{28}\text{Si}^*$

======= Method and Results =======

===== Experimental Setup =====
!bslidecell 00
    * Cyclotron accelerates 16 MeV proton in a spiralling motion using an electric field.
    * A magnetic field bends the particles trajectory.
    * Particle is then ejected from the cyclotron.

===== Experimental Setup =====
!bslidecell 00
    * Particle accelerator with CACTUS and SiRi detectors.
    * Spherically distributed NaI scintillators captures photons emitted from excited nucleus.
    * Silicon Ring detects energy of ejected proton.

===== Data Analysis – Particle Calibration =====

!bslidecell 00
    * SiRi consists of eight Silicon pieces.
    * Each of these have two parts: $\Delta E$ and $E$.
    * $\Delta E$ measures an energy loss of proton and $E$ stops the particle.
    * Divided into another eight strips to measure angle.
    * Approximately linear energy $E(x) = a + bx$.
    * $a$ and $b$ called gain and shift. Adjusted to calibrate detectors.
    * Plot $\Delta E/E$ and see the bananas.

===== Data Analysis – Selecting a Reaction =====

!bslidecell 00
    * Gate on the banana for the ejected proton and sort again.
    * We see the apparent thickness of the $\Delta E$ detector, which corresponds to the known value 130 $\mu m$

===== Data Analysis – Selecting a Reaction =====

!bslidecell 00
    * We project the coincidence matrix on the y-axis.
    * Excitation energy $E_x$ vs. photon count
    * Compare to known values for the excitation values of the first six levels.

===== Data Analysis – Gamma Calibration =====

!bslidecell 00
    * Correct for the gain and shift as done for SiRi.
    * Leading edge discriminators (LEDs).
        * Looks at the leading edge of signal after some threshold.
        * Gives timing variance.
        * Amplitude of signal dependent on energy.
            * Curve fitting.
    * Background radiation.
        * Start experiment without reaction.
    * Delayed gamma rays, random coincidences.
        * Gate on corresponding peak and substract from the prompt peak.

===== The Coincidence Matrix =====

!bslidecell 00
    * The corrected coincidence matrix for $E_\gamma$ vs. $E_x$.
    * Particle, gamma and time calibrated, without background raditation.

===== The Oslo Method =====
!bslidecell 00
    * We find the coincidence matrix to perform the Oslo Method.
    * Can extract the nuclear level density (NLD) $\rho$ and gamma strength function (GSF) $\tau$ in one experiment.
    * $\rho$ and $\tau $ can be used to find probaility $P$ for the reaction
    * $P(E_x,E_\gamma) \propto \tau (E_\gamma) \cdot \rho(E_x-E_\gamma)$.
!eslidecell 

!bslidecell 01
Three steps:
    o Unfolding the gamma ray spectrum.
    o Extracting the 1st gen. gamma rays.
    o Extracting NLD and GSF.
Where the last step was not part of our project.

===== The Oslo Method – Unfolding of the Coincidence Matrix =====
!bslidecell 00
The gamma ray interacts with the detector in several ways:
    * Photoelectric effect.
    * Compton scattering
    * Pair production (electron/positron, single or double escape).
We *unfold* the matrix by reducing everything, but the photoelectric effect.
    * Need a response matrix $v_{out} = R v_{in}$. to find the unfolded coincidence matrix.

===== The Oslo Method – Multiplicity =====
!bslidecell 00
    The multiplicity $\langle M \rangle$ is defined as the average number of gamma rays emitted for a given excitation level $E_x$.
!eslidecell

!bslidecell 01
Two methods:
    o $\langle M \rangle = \frac{E_x}{\langle E_\gamma \rangle}$
    o $\langle M \rangle = k\cdot \frac{N_c}{N_s}$
        * $N_c$ is the coincidence spectrum (proton in coincidence) and $N_s$ is the single spectrum, corresponding to to our bananas.
        * k is a constant we find by using a known multiplicity.
