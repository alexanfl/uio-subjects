\section{Bioimpedance Basics}
\subsection{Impedance}
The inverse value of resistance is \textit{conductance}. 
\textbf{Only true for Ohmish systems!}
The inverse value of impedance is \textit{admittance}
Impedance is the hypotenus of resistance $R$ and reactance $X$ (imaginary part).
Admittance is the hypotenus of conductance $G$ and susceptance $B$ (imaginary part).

In biological matter, voltage is in phase behind current.

Kramers-Kronig theory: there is a connection between the frequency and
the phase angle, how the module changes.

\subsection{Electrode Systems}
In biological matter, ions are the charge carriers, not electrons.
They don't move as fast as electrons. An \textit{electrode}
is the barrier when going from electrons to ions as charge carriers.

The outer part of the skin is a bad conductor, 
since the skin cells are dead (500 k$\Omega$).

Four-electrode systems are most in use. Measure voltage on the two electrodes in the middle.
Measures \textit{transfer impedance}, not real impedance!
