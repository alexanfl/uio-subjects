First lecture in percolation

Four projects.

Programs in percolation are given, 
must write own programs in molecular dynamics.

Oil production:
  - Used to produce oil from porous media.
    - Use the same mathematical tools as in phase transitions.
    - Fuel cells can copy the way lungs work, to increase efficiency.
    - n micro scale, we can use continuum mechanics.
    - On nano scale, we must address it differently.

1. Md. dyn.
  - Four weeks
2. MD
3. General description of disordered porous media.
  - Scaling.
4. Project
  - 10 min. presentation
  - 1/2-1 wk. work.

Probability of liquid to go through media: $p \in [0,1]$, 
$p_c$ is critical probability.


\eq{
  \rho = \frac{M}{V}\\
  \rho \propto (p-p_c)^{\beta}
}

Result: $M \propto L^{1.89}$

\eq{
  \Rightarrow \rho = \frac{M}{V} \propto \frac{L^{1.89}}{L^2} = L^{-0.11}
}
